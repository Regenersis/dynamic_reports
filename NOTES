# Feedback
# it would be nice if it was just a template handler in Rails
# ActionView::TemplateHandlers::ERB
# since your stuff is all ERB you can just return the file contents I think
# and then you also want to add a RenderOption, but I think RenderOptions are limited to completely taking over the process atm, instead of supplementing
# so we have to do something about that



# Should be able to hook reports into models directly somehow, cleanly
#
